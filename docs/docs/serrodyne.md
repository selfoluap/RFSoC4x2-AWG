## Serrodyne modulation principle

From top to bottom, the figure below illustrates the successive steps of the modulation process.

The first panel shows the unmodulated optical field in the time domain,
corresponding to a monochromatic laser at the carrier frequency \( f_0 \).
The second panel shows the corresponding frequency spectrum, which consists of
a single spectral line at \( f_0 \).

The third panel shows the applied phase modulation signal \( \phi(t) \), which
is a linear phase ramp with periodic \( 2\pi \) resets. This sawtooth-shaped
phase evolution is generated by applying a corresponding voltage waveform to
the electro-optic modulator.

Applying this phase modulation to the optical field results in the signal shown
in the fourth panel. While the waveform remains sinusoidal in the time domain,
the linear phase evolution causes a constant shift in the instantaneous optical
frequency.

The final panel shows the frequency spectrum of the modulated optical field.
The optical power is transferred into a single sideband at the shifted frequency
\( f_0 + \Delta f \), with minimal residual power at the original carrier
frequency. This illustrates the central advantage of serrodyne modulation:
efficient, single-sideband frequency shifting without the generation of
unwanted sidebands.
